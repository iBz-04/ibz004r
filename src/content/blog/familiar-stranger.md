## Introduction



From the suburbs of Accra, I met my first close friends. We had the best years: we invented games, flew kites, and argued about how sweet the biscuits tasted. We knew each other better than anyone. Then the worst happened - I had to leave for another city.

They asked when I would come back. I smiled and said, "Soon." I never came back.

## The Cycle Begins

Moving to a new city felt unfamiliar at first: new faces, awkward introductions, and the strange feeling of leaving a perfect life behind. Time passed, and the city became routine. I made new friends and a new home. Familiarity slipped through my fingers until the new place felt like home.

Then the cycle began again: more moves, new schools, the same pattern of strangeness, acceptance, and familiarity.

By middle school I learned to accept the cycle. At graduation I watched my classmates and smiled quietly - I knew we would scatter to different high schools, even if some hoped otherwise. They celebrated the end of school; I felt sorrow at another separation. The cycle had become my companion.

## The Familiar Stranger

High school was different. I was older and farther from family. I kept to myself on the first night of introductions, afraid to give anyone hope that I would stay. I did not want new attachments for their sake.

Then someone burst in through the window and introduced himself. He had no idea what he had started.

We had the best days. For a while I forgot my fear. We lived as if each day were new, even through the difficulties of school. But the cycle returned. On a cold graduation night I left again.

This time I left everything behind - family, friends, the life I knew. I promised myself I would return soon.

## Breaking the Cycle

When I did go back, things had changed. Some people were there but not the same. Jokes I didn't understand, stories I had missed, a house with altered furniture - even the rules of the country felt altered. I became a stranger in my own world: familiar, but not recognized.

I returned hoping to find what I had left, but it had shifted. This time I was the one left behind.

I became a stranger to myself. I had no fixed home.

## Conclusion

Now I avoid looking back. When you leave something behind, it often disappears. I find comfort where there are no people — where no one can mistake familiarity for permanence.

I sit and breathe the present: no movement, only stillness. I try to hold off the approaching change, pleading silently for more time. The cycle follows me everywhere.

I miss the privilege of staying in one place. If you have that stability, appreciate it.
