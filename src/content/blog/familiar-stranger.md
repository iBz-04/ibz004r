## Introduction

From the suburbs of Accra, I met my first best buddies, we had the best years, created our own games and played them, flew kites and talked about how sweet the biscuits we just ate were, we knew each other better than anyone, then the worst happened, I had to leave, I had to move to another city.

The first goodbye.

They asked when I would come back, I smiled and said soon.
I never came back.

## The Cycle Begins

Moving to a different city felt new and unfamiliar, I had to get used to it, new faces and the introductions, people taking time before remembering your name and the feeling of having left a perfect life behind, time elapsed and I got used to it, it did not feel new anymore, I made new friends and a new routine, I had to accept leaving my past behind and moving on.

Familiarity slipped through my mind and the new city became home.
Then again, my enemy struck, moving.

It was time for middle school and the cycle started again, strangeness, acceptance, familiarity, home.

By then I was used to the cycle, although unexpected, I learned to accept it, at the graduation of middle school I looked over to my mates and smiled because I knew we would end up in different high schools, although my friends hoped we would attend the same one, but I knew sometimes hope is a cruel thing.

They rejoiced at finishing school and having the workload off their backs, but I sat in sorrow of the separation from family and friends, it was not a new feeling, the cycle had become my friend.

## The Familiar Stranger

Fast forward, my arrival at high school was different, I was grown now, there was more work to do, but more importantly I was truly away from my family, going home was not easy but it was still possible by bus.

I accepted my fate and embraced the new life, routine, new faces, new feelings.

During the first night when people were introducing themselves I sat in a corner, I should not speak, I should not give anyone hope of me being around for long, I did not want new friends, for their own good.

I was the familiar stranger, I appear with familiarity and leave like a stranger after a short time.

I pictured the day of graduation and separation right on the first day.

Then I saw a guy jump through the window and introduce himself, he did not know what he had just caused.

We had the best days, it made me forget my fear, we lived every day like a brand new life through the difficulties of high school.

Then the enemy caught up with us and it was a cold night when we graduated and I had to leave again.
I expected it, but it was greater than I thought.

This time I had to leave my entire world behind, my family, friends, home, life, feelings, lifestyle, it was a greater battle than I expected.

They asked me when I was coming back, I smiled and said soon.

I moved with a heavy heart and promised myself to return soon.

I met my friend again, the cycle.

## Breaking the Cycle

Then I decided to break the cycle by going back, the voice in my head said you can go back but no one will be there, I disagreed and went back anyway.

It was true, not entirely, but true.

They were there, but they were not.

New things had happened, my friends made jokes I did not understand, my family talked about events I did not know, the decoration of the house had changed, the laws of the country had changed.

I was a stranger in my own world, the familiar stranger.

I returned hoping to see things the way I left them, but it was not like that.

This time I was the one left behind.

I was a stranger to myself.
I have no home.

I wonder when it will end.

## Conclusion

Now I look at the people I have around and feel sorrow, now that I have no home I do not look back anymore, because once you leave something behind it disappears.

This is why I enjoy my time where there are no people, that way no one makes the mistake of knowing me.

The familiar stranger.

This is why I like to sit and enjoy the time I have, no movement, just sitting silently and inhaling the present, taking my mind away from the enemy approaching, begging for more time from my friend, the cycle, because it follows me everywhere I go.

I miss the privilege of being in one place.
If you have it, appreciate it.
